# **Debug Mode** #

---

## What is it? ##

Debug Mode will likely be a flag that will allow the user to use additional commands. These will be used to make it easier for the user to find bugs and/or see interaction between game objects.

## What features will be allowed in Debug Mode? ##

To be discussed.

## Who is it for? ##

Designers and Developers

## Other ##

Maybe having two additional modes, one "Debug, one "Design" or "Editor". The editor would do what you would expect, and allow the user to edit and create game objects.

Debug could be used as a test, so the user would be able to change states of any object through using commands to test various things. I can see this being useful with Events and possibly complex narrative where certain conditions need to be met before something happens. The user could just set the conditions, instead of having to go through everything to see if a change or addition works as expected.
