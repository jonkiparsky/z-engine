#summary Statement of and dissension about coding style.

= The Style =

Brace style:
The One True Brace Style will be followed: align curly braces under first character of the line that introduces the block:

{{{
  if (a == b)
  {
    if (a > 7)
    {
      a -= 14;
    }
    else
    {
    a += 7;
    }
  }
}}}


Line length:
80-column lines. They're easier to read.

Special pleading for changes to the coding style will be entertained below. If they are very entertaining, they may even be considered. :)
