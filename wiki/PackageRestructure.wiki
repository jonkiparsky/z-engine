=Package Restructuring=
----
==What is it?==

Restructuring of source so that users can create games without having to delve in to Engine code.

==What will change?==

Rooms, Items and Commands will be added outside Z-Engine, then implemented in. Additional features will also follow this design. 

==How will it effect development?==

Users will be able to easily create objects and integrate them with their game, whilst the Engine can parse them correctly.

==Other==

Rooms and Items shouldn't be hard to externalize. Commands, on the other hand, will be difficult with the current way of doing things, as the primitive commands that are executed are in the Engine. Thoughts about how to change this?
